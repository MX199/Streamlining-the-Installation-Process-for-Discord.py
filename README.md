  <h1>This code is a Python script that installs and tests discord.py library, which is used to create bots for Discord. It uses the subprocess module to run pip commands in the terminal and handles any errors or outputs. It also tries to import discord.py and prints a message depending on whether it succeeds or fails.</h1>
